This Folder is the "Project" Folder. This will have the
Django Files (in "/MadLads/MadLads") and "templates" which
has HTML,CSS, and JavaScript files in them. As of right now
I'm not sure as to how the css and javascript will be implemented but
we will figure that out as we go.

This folder also has our sqlite
database code. We will access the database using sqlite browser
which I will help you install.

manage.py is a file that handles starting and quiting the server and
other server control things.
